Thank you so much for reading this! I loved working with Nate and the rest of the team. Thank you so much for your support.

This is honestly one of the mods I've been the most passionate for in a LONG time. I tried working the best my body and mind
would let me. Even though I found Tyler and the other thirst bait OCs extremelly annoying with how much they were posted in
the middle of dev chat, I enjoyed meeting and talking with new people. Nate is a very skilled artist and director, and friend.
